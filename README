~~~~~~	EasyPi Pi Calculator  ~~~~~~

EasyPi is a super portable Pi Calculator (with GUI!) written in Python. The program uses 3 different algorithms which include Plouffe, Bellard and Chudnovsky to calculate Pi to a user-defined precision and amount of iterations. 

The program itself is written in pure Python with no additional libraries. However, GUI is powered by EasyGUI, which means that you'd have to download needed dependencies prior to running the code on your own. I may change what GUI program I use in the future based on the feedback I get and how much time I have.

The program is currently in Development build 02-07-2014_01. I will keep working on it with the aim of making it more user-friendly, less buggy, and potentially more helpful to students, mathematicians and even computer scientists. Please refer to CHANGELOG for improvements and/or changes in each version.

UPDATE: I'm currently working on a Tk GUI version of the EasyPi software as I think that multi-windowed GUI is kind of cumbersome and confusing to the users. There's currently no definite release date as this is the first time I'll be working with Tk.
